# Automation Scripts for Tampermonkey on IMS

This repository contains scripts for Tampermonkey, a Chrome extension, that automate tasks on IMS - Interpreter Managing System. Previously, I used the [Autoclick](https://github.com/inket/Autoclick) solution, but this prevented me from using my computer for other tasks simultaneously.

- **calendarPickTodays:** Always selects today's date, so you can track today's call duration.
- **callAutoAnswer:** Auto-answers calls, allowing for computer use during operation.

## Usage

To keep picking up calls, refresh the page after each call.
